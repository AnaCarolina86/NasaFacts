This is a project I started when I was following a React.js course that applies the concept of using modules. 
Thus, for each component of the application there is a css file.

However, for the past few weeks I have been working offline on this project, using Bootstrap and adding new components.

Note: it is necessary to install a couple of things to run this project locally (node.js, npm and bootstrap).
