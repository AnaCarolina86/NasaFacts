# NasaFacts

This is a project I started when I was following a React.js course that applies the concept of using modules. 
Thus, for each component of the application there is a css file.

However, for the past few weeks I have been working offline on this project, using Bootstrap and adding new components.

Note: it is necessary to install a couple of things to run this project locally (node.js, npm and bootstrap).

### How I started

After following a basic React.js course, I decided to attend one with a more complex project, that is why I chose [this](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-building-styles-with-css-modules). 
It was great for me, because this project applies ES6 and components, so you really need to understand how everything works together.

### Before put it in GitHub

I added four new components, (Title, Gallery, GalleryItem, and Bottom) for a couple of reasons. First, I needed to check if I really understood what I was doing. For that, I created a new json file with some information from the Nasa website, and I built components in order to use properly this file. Another reason, I wanted to improve the website sytle.

### Content

I used public information from [Nasa](https://www.nasa.gov/) in order to show some interesting facts. This data was "stored" in a json file. 

### Next

Yes, I am going to continue developing this project. I am learning how to use Bootstrap in a React project.
